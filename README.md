# GeeksForGeeks Coursework Repository

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and practice projects completed on **[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)** as part of my learning journey. The primary goal is to document progress, maintain version control, and build a structured record of concepts learned through coding practice.

## Repository Structure


Each folder corresponds to a specific **programming language** or **course** on GeeksForGeeks. Within each folder, files are organized by **week** or **topic**.
